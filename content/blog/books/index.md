Yes, I will read them all.

I'm recording this because I'm a nerd. I take pride in my reading lists. But also because I think studying existing artistic frameworks and pedagogies is an important part of the work of learning to draw.

The most important action to take in learning to draw is drawing. But I always marry my action with study and reflection. When I tally up the minutes I spend learning to draw on this site, I include the time I spend reading.

Throughout this year I'll survey dozens of books and tutorials on how to draw and I'll highlight bits and pieces gleaned from there along the way.
