In my sporadic research of other drawers and artists I found an illustrator who
wanted to discipline himself as an artist by spending 1 year doing the same thing
everyday, refining his craft and his ideas. So he draw a ![White Ibis cartoon](http://www.struthless.com/prints) every day for a year.

That sounded like an interesting challenge.

I decided to devote this year to record players. Partly because it's a easy enough
to start with while having great potential to become more dynamic and challenging.
But, more importantly, the first art I learned from and loved in life was rap music.
So every time I draw a record player I feel I am homage to all those artists who
helped make me who I am.
